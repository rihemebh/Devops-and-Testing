## 1. Testing 

In this project we are using 3 types of tesing : 


### Unit Testing

Unit testing is a type of testing to check if the small piece of code or a single function is doing as per the expectation.
Example :

**Code**

```python
def calculate_factorial(number):
    if number == 1 or number == 0:
        return 1
    fact = calculate_factorial(number-1)
    return fact * number
```

**Test**

```python
 def test_calculate_factorial(self):
        # Given
        number = 3
        expected_result = 6
        # When
        result = calculate_factorial(number)
        # Then
        assert result == expected_result
```
## Integration testing

Integration testing is the phase of software testing in which individual software modules are combined and tested as a group. 
It follows unit testing and precedes system testing.
Integration testing takes as its input **modules that have been unit tested**, groups them in larger aggregates, applies tests defined in an integration test plan to those aggregates, and delivers as its output the integrated system ready for system testing.

#### What is the difference between unit and integration testing?
While unit tests always take results from a single unit, such as a function call, integration tests may aggregate results from various parts and sources.

 Integration testing might require acting like a consumer or user of the application by:

- Calling an HTTP REST API
- Calling an API
- Calling a web service


## E2E Testing


End-to-end testing is a technique that tests the entire software product from beginning to end to ensure the application flow behaves as expected. It defines the productâ€™s system dependencies and ensures all integrated pieces work together as expected.
